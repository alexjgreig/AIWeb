          <p>
	  Artificial Intelligence is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable." (John McCarthy, Stanford).

	      An expert system is a subset of AI that is used to perform functions that would normally be performed by a human expert in that field. A doctor may utilise an expert system to diagnose illnesses or economist may implement an expert system to forecast economic trends. Expert systems make decisions on input data through predefined rules and a knowledge base.

	      Artificial Intelligence can be categorised be its versatility and intellectual capacity. Narrow Artificial Intelligence comprises the majority of AI and is trained to perform specific tasks such as Natural Language Processing or autonomous driving. Artificial General Intelligence is a theoretical form of AI where the machines intelligence is equivalent to that of humans; it would possess a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to solve problems, learn and predict the future. Finally, Artificial Super Intelligence would surpass human intelligence and the ability of the human brain.

        Artifical Intelligence Models and Algorithms
      </h3>
      <div class="container">
      <p> Artificial Intelligence models are the algorithms that are used to train computers to process and analyse data. Certain models fall under machine learning, a process in which a computer continually adjusts parameters to better solve problems, and therefore, learns from the past. Deep learning is the way that machine learning functions, it is where a machine develops an algorithm after encountering vast amounts of data rather than functioning off a predetermined algorithm. </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="assets/deep.png" alt="" />
        </div>
      <p> Artificial Intelligence models can be categorised under supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning models. Supervised learning requires human input to tag sets of data. This enables the machine to learn based on a human analysis of the data. On the contrary, unsupervised learning functions without human input, indicating patterns in the data and learning through these patterns. Finally, reinforcement learning is the process of a machine learning through its interaction with its environment in a trial-and-error style. </p>
        <div class="image">
          <img src="assets/models.png" alt="" />
        </div>
      <p> Artificial Intelligence algorithms can also be characterised be the problems that they solve, there are three main processes that they perform. Classification is the process of providing a binary response, yes or no, to a problem, such as: is this photo of a dog? Regression is the process of predicting a continuous variable’s value from previous data, this is seen heavily in temperature prediction. Clustering is the process of grouping data together in “clusters” and finding anomalies.

          <h3 class="milestone-number">Supervised Learning</h3>
          <h4 class="milestone-content">Supervised learning functions as a predictive model that utilises training data; data which has an input and an expected output. The model runs a training period that adjusts the algorithm, stopping only when the required results are outputted from the model. Algorithms that fall under this category are decision trees, naïve Bayes classifiers, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and regressions.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="milestone">
          <h3 class="milestone-number">Unsupervised Learning</h3>
          <h4 class="milestone-content">An unsupervised learning algorithm does not need labelled training data to learn, instead it analyses and clusters unlabelled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for processes such as clustering, association between variables and dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is a technique used when the number of features, or dimensions, in a dataset is too high. It tries to minimise random variables into a smaller set of principle variables while still maintaining the integrity of the previous data. K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, gaussian mixture models, principal component analysis and autoencoders are examples of unsupervised learning algorithms.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="milestone">
          <h3 class="milestone-number">Reinforcement Learning</h3>
          <h4 class="milestone-content">Reinforcement Learning is an algorithm that functions through a “trial and error” system. The model carries out a task over numerous iterations under different conditions and aims to achieve a specific objective; if completed the algorithm is computationally “rewarded.” In this model, the machine constantly tunes certain parameters of the algorithm until it reaches the highest level of reward and thus an optimum pathway to the problem has been discovered. Through this particular learning method, discovery of patterns, correlations and conclusions that are complex and unexpected are found. Algorithms such as dynamic programming, Q-learning and SARSA (state-action-reward-state-action) are utilised to achieve this learning process.</h4>

            <div class="description">
		    Machine learning can be used to forecast and predict prices; build, optimise and diversify portfolios; perform sentiment analysis; or provide the foundation behind statistical arbitrage, a strategy heavily used by top quantitative hedge funds to exploit the inefficiencies of the market. Analysing sentiment within news articles or prominent macroeconomic indicators is useful as the financial market fluctuates as a result of people’s positive or negative perception. Therefore, sentiment analysis allows trading algorithms to gauge the overall trend of a financial instrument and is utilised to identify large movements that allow for profit. An example of its profitability is seen within GBP/USD in 2016, with negative sentiment sending GBP slumping to a 31-year low following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Through analysing numerous news sources and macroeconomic factors, machine learning deduced the polarity of the event and in turn forecasted the downfall of the currency.

            <div class="description">
		This sentiment classification is formulated as a two-class classification problem, positive and negative. This type of sentiment analysis can be achieved through training a supervised machine learning model, Support Vector Machines (SVM), on labelled data and then running the model on other processed information. Firstly, to prepare the data, the algorithm will tokenize the source of information, splitting the text into words and phrases and remove words without dependency such as conjunctions and prepositions.  Then it will perform feature extraction, a process of transforming the input data into set of representative features that the SVM model can classify and understand. After this, the SVM model learns which features are positive or negative and then can decipher the polarity of new information. More specifically to algorithmic trading, it can determine from this whether a financial instrument will be bearish or bullish.

            <div class="name">Statistical Arbitrage</div>
            <div class="description">
		    Statistical arbitrage is one of the pillars of quantitative trading and has long been used by hedge funds and investment banks. The strategy identifies and exploits temporal price differences between similar assets. Machine learning can be implemented to enable quantitative traders to efficiently build portfolios of similar assets and trade pairs of assets against each other when prices diverge. One method to cluster similar assets together is by first utilising a convolutional autoencoder model to return features of the time-series data, and then feeding these features to a K-means clustering algorithm, returning similar assets. Therefore, the model forecasts which assets are highly probable to mimic another asset and can thus generate profit when they diverge from a mean price. This method enables high frequency execution and processing of large amounts of data, therefore, enabling hedge funds and investment banks to computationally find anomalies in the vast mass of data, a needle in a haystack.

          <div class="title">Ethical Issues Surrounding Artifical Intelligence</div>
          <div class="subTitle">
		  Humanity’s dominance over earth is due to our intelligence and ingenuity, however, what if this was not the case? <br><br> The most frightening ethical issue surrounding artificial intelligence is the notion of the technological singularity, a point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. The technological singularity would occur if artificial intelligence reaches a level of intelligence equivalent to humans, and thus, these systems would have the ability to develop AI systems that surpass the human level of intelligence. Therefore, the ethical question arises of whether humanity should slow the development of artificial intelligence before it spirals out of control or if regulations should be introduced to prevent unsafe development. A key ingredient driving the debate is Moore’s law, which describes the doubling of transistor densities on chips roughly every 18 months, which has held true since the 1960s. As densities increase, so too does computational power and thus the power of artificial intelligence. Along with this, the development of artificial intelligent models and algorithms has been increasing exponentially. <br><br>
		  Therefore, ethical guidance and regulation must be undertaken to prevent the singularity, or the artificial intelligent model must incorporate rules of ethics to aid humanity instead of harming it when it does reach a singularity. Three types of normative ethics that are in contention are deontic systems with rules, such as Asimov’s laws; Aristotelian virtue ethics, which identify moral characteristics; and consequentialism, which identifies moral value through actions consequences. The forefront of AI ethics suggests that Bayesian networks should be implemented to maximise proper decision making instead of attempting to incorporate natural language processing, another process that allows for misinterpretation by machines. These Artificial ethical issues must be resolved, as without a solution Artificial intelligence may:<br><br><em> “Take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded.” </em> <br><br>-Stephen Hawking, English Theoretical Physicist.
